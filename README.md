# About this Project

This project is submission 4 of the Udacity Frontend Developer Nanodegree course.

It contains a User Interface where the user can enter a url to a news article and gets an answer about the polarity of the article and the polarity confidence.
An example result could be: "The polarity of the article is neutral. Polarity confidence is 0.5853245258331299".

This is achieved by sending a request to process the article at the given url to Aylien, an API that provides Natural language processing (NLP).

Working on this project included:

- Setting up Webpack
- Sass styles
- Webpack Loaders and Plugins
- Service workers
- Using APIs and creating requests to external urls
- Using environment variables
- Testing with Jest
